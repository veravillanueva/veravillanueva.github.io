			<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
			<p class="gray-twenty">I live near the Yale University Art Gallery (YUAG) and often visit the museum for both work and fun. I have long felt that some parts of the YUAG's mobile app are a bit hard to navigate, so I performed an unsolicited redesign of the UI to see if I could make it more accessible. Since I don’t have access to user data or research about the app’s current design, I relied on my own experience as a frequent visitor to the museum and did my best to maintain the overall feel of the app.</p>

	<section class="language-options">
		<div class="middle">
			<h3 class="gray-ten">Language Options</h3>
			<h4>PROBLEM</h4>
			<p class="gray-ten">The current language options are buried under layers of menus. This is an issue for the many international tourists who visit the gallery every day.</p>
		</div>	
		<div class="center"><img id="language-options-one" src="images/language-options-one.png" alt="user flow"></div>
		<div class="middle">
			<h5>SOLUTION</h5>
			<p class="gray-ten">I inserted a screen immediately before the home page as a one-time prompt to allow users to set a language before using the app. If they accidentally choose the wrong language at the outset, no worries! The language options are easily accessible at the top of the home page.</p>

	<section class="audio">
		<div class="audio-text">
			<h3 class="white-text">Audio</h3>
			<br>
			<p class="white-text">The original UI does not let users listen to audio and browse other parts of the app at the same time. I redesigned the interface to allow audio pages to be minimized and added a dark background in order to draw less attention to the screen and emphasize the central image.</p>

		<img id="permanent-collection" src="images/permanent-collection.png" alt="user flow">
		<div class="permanent-collection-text">
		<h3 class="gray-ten">Permanent Collection</h3>
		<br>
		<p class="gray-ten">There is currently no way to access the images and descriptions of the YUAG’s permanent exhibition, which constitutes the majority of the gallery’s collection. I made sure to include them in my redesign.</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<section class="special-exhibitions">
		<div class="middle">
			<h3 class="white-text">Special Exhibitions</h3>
			<h4>PROBLEM</h4>
			<p class="white-text">Descriptions of special exhibitions, a main attraction of the museum, are virtually non-existent in the original UI. There is only a link to the gallery’s website, which is poorly adapted for phone screens.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="center"><img id="special-exhibtions-one" src="images/special-exhibitions-one.png" alt="user flow"></div>
		<div class="middle">
			<h5>SOLUTION</h5>
			<p class="white-text">I included links to both special exhibitions and permanent exhibitions on the home page and developed a template to showcase specific collections of work.</p>
